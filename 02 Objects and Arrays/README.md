One reason why OOP is so valuable is the concept of inheritance. This is powerful because it provides code reuse, and makes your code more modular as you can associate properties/methods with certain objects, like “animal” or “dog”, and objects lower on the chain can simply inherit those properties, so we don’t have to explicitly define all of the properties on of these object.
