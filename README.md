# JavaScript Jumpstart
This repo includes 10 lessons I "assembled" for coming up to speed on the JavaScript programming language (ECMAscript). These lectures were created for the purpose of isolated, 2 hour lectures with interactive coding examples and whiteboarding for more complex concepts. The coding snippets have been included for these individual lessons, but bviously the value of in person instruction, whiteboarding, slide animations, and additional 3rd party tools like REPL's cannot be included here. Please also note that since these sections have been developed for isolated 2 hour lectures, some important slides and concepts are intentionally repeated.

If you are interesting in coming to an in-person JavaScript lesson, please sign up on MakerSquare's meetup page. Meetups occur regularly on Tuesday's at 6pm PST.

####Note: I do not own all the content in these slides, as some concept explanatiaons and several screenshots taken from various sources like mdn documentation, blogs, books, additional documentation. I will try to add links to the bottom of these slides or to a sources slide at the end of each lesson.

The logic of how to introduce concepts and a majority of this material was created specifically by me for MakerSquare's Meetup. The goal of these lessons are to help beginners learn JavaScript, and some explanations have been so perfectly crafted by other people/sources, it makes more sense to compile these concepts and anecdotes instead of having me recreate them to my best attempt. I only care about teaching others in the quickest and most concise way possible. (I give this same disclaimer to everyone who shows up for the meetup)
