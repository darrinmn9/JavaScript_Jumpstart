This repo includes 9 lessons I "assembled" for coming up to speed on the JavaScript programming language (ECMAscript). These lectures were created for the purpose of isolated, 2 hour lectures with interactive coding examples and whiteboarding for more complex concepts. The coding snippets have been included for these individual lessons, but obviously the value of in-person instruction, whiteboarding, slide animations, and additional 3rd party tools like REPL's cannot be easily included here. Please also note that since these sections have been developed for isolated 2 hour lectures, some important slides and concepts are intentionally repeated.

If you are interesting in coming to an in-person JavaScript lesson, please sign up on MakerSquare's meetup page. Meetups occur regularly on Tuesday's at 6pm PST.

**Note:** I do not own all the content in these slides, as some concept explanatiaons and several screenshots taken from various sources like mdn documentation, blogs, books, additional documentation. I will try to add links to the bottom of these slides or to a sources slide at the end of each lesson.

The logic of how to introduce concepts and a majority of this material was created by me for MakerSquare's Meetup. The goal of these lessons are to help beginners and programmers coming from a differente language learn JavaScript. Some explanations have been so perfectly crafted by other people/sources, it makes more sense to compile these concepts and anecdotes instead of having me recreate them to my best attempt. I only care about teaching others in the quickest, most effective and concise way possible. (I give this same disclaimer to everyone who shows up for the meetup)
